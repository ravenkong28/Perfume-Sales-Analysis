# Perfume-Sales-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed perfume sales data from an e-commerce platform to uncover insights. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 2,000 entries split evenly by gender, covering brands, types, prices, and availability. This analysis aims to identify customer preferences and provide actionable recommendations for e-commerce stakeholders.

Through this analysis, I've laid the groundwork for strategic decision-making in perfume e-commerce. By understanding customer preferences and adjusting stock and marketing efforts, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction and drive revenue growth.
